    "# Introduction\n",

    "## Using this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook helps you to analyze datasets and to find interesting and meaningful patterns in the data. If you are only interested in looking at an automated report outlining the most important features of your dataset, you can upload your datafile via the *dataset* variable and run the notebook. Afterwards, you can export the report as HTML and read it in a webbrowser.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in a more interactive analysis of your data, you can also adapt the parameters of the notebook to suit your needs. Each section conatins several values which can be adapted to your needs. These values are described in the code comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if you want to go beyond an automated report and answer your own questions, you can look at the final section of the notebook and use the code examples there to generate your own figures and analysis from the data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading this report in a webbrowser\n",
    "\n",
    "This report uses several statistical methods and specific phrases and concepts from the domains of statistics and machine learning. Whenever such methods are used, a small \"Explanation\" sign at the side of the report marks a short explanation of the methods and phrases. Clicking it will reveal the explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can toggle the global visibility of these explanations with a button at the top left corner of the report. The code can also be toggled with a button.\n",
    "\n",
    "All graphs are interactive and will display additional content on hover. You can get the exact values of the functions by selecting the assoziated areas in the graph. You can also move the plots around and zoom into interesting parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aknowledgments\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is build on the MSPN implementation by Molina et.al. during the course of a bachelor thesis under the supervision of Alejandro Molina and Kristian Kersting at TU Darmstadt. The goal of this framework is to sum product networks for hybrid domains and to highlight important aspects and interesting features of a given dataset."
